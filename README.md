# Fourier_Transformation

Fourier transformation: A mathematical technique used to analyze and decompose complex signals or functions into simpler sinusoidal components.

First, decomposing the time series data into its constituent frequency components using Fourier transformation.

Second, identifying the dominant frequency components in the time series.

Third, predicting future values based on these frequencies.
